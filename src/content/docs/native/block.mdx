description: block is a way to create React Native components with attached styles.

Block is available in your `blocks.config.ts` file. Block was inspired 100% by the [emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs) library.

> Note that we did not integrate emotion, but rather drew inspiration from this great library to create the block utility.

## Styling components

block has a great similarity to css for creating your styled components, except that block must be instantiated with a React Native component and then called with a template literal for string styles or a normal function call for object styles.

```tsx
import { block } from "[path-to]/blocks.config";

const DescriptionBlock = block.Text`
  color: blue;
`;

return <DescriptionBlock>Hello World</DescriptionBlock>;
```

## Styling based on props and object styles

Any interpolation or function argument with `block` is called with `props`, allowing you to change the styles of a component based on `props`.

```tsx
import { block } from "[path-to]/blocks.config";

const TitleBlock = block.Text(({ theme }) => ({
  color: theme.colros.red[950],
  fontSize: theme.fontSizes.xl,
}));

const ContainerBlock = block.View(({ theme }) => ({
  display: "flex",
  flexDirection: "column",
  justifyContent: "center",
  alignItems: "center",
  width: theme.sizes.xl,
}));

return (
  <ContainerBlock>
    <TitleBlock>Hello World</TitleBlock>
  </ContainerBlock>
);
```

## Styling any component

block can style any React Native component, just instantiate it with the component you want to style.

```tsx
import { ScrollView, View, Text } from "react-native";
import { block } from "[path-to]/blocks.config";

const ScrollViewBlock = block(ScrollView)(({ theme }) => ({
  backgroundColor: theme.colors.green[950],
  height: "100%",
}));

const TitleBlock = block(Text)(({ theme }) => ({
  color: theme.colros.red[950],
  fontSize: theme.fontSizes.xl,
}));

const ContainerBlock = block(View)(({ theme }) => ({
  display: "flex",
  flexDirection: "column",
  justifyContent: "center",
  alignItems: "center",
  width: theme.sizes.xl,
}));

return (
  <ScrollViewBlock>
    <ContainerBlock>
      <TitleBlock>Hello World</TitleBlock>
    </ContainerBlock>
  </ScrollViewBlock>
);
```

> You could treat block as you would with [styled from emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/styled)
