# installation

A quick tutorial to get you up and running with Radix Primitives.

## Implementing a Popover

In this quick tutorial, we will install and style the [Popover](../components/popover) component.

### 1. Install the primitive

Install the component from your command line.

```bash
npm install @radix-ui/react-popover@latest -E
```

### 2. Import the parts

Import and structure the parts.

```jsx line=3,6-14
// index.jsx
import * as React from "react";
import * as Popover from "@radix-ui/react-popover";

const PopoverDemo = () => (
  <Popover.Root>
    <Popover.Trigger>More info</Popover.Trigger>
    <Popover.Portal>
      <Popover.Content>
        Some more infoâ€¦
        <Popover.Arrow />
      </Popover.Content>
    </Popover.Portal>
  </Popover.Root>
);

export default PopoverDemo;
```

### 3. Add your styles

Add styles where desired.

```jsx line=4,8,10,12
// index.jsx
import * as React from "react";
import * as Popover from "@radix-ui/react-popover";
import "./styles.css";

const PopoverDemo = () => (
  <Popover.Root>
    <Popover.Trigger __className__="PopoverTrigger">Show info</Popover.Trigger>
    <Popover.Portal>
      <Popover.Content __className__="PopoverContent">
        Some content
        <Popover.Arrow __className__="PopoverArrow" />
      </Popover.Content>
    </Popover.Portal>
  </Popover.Root>
);

export default PopoverDemo;
```

```css
/* styles.css */
.PopoverTrigger {
  background-color: white;
  border-radius: 4px;
}

.PopoverContent {
  border-radius: 4px;
  padding: 20px;
  width: 260px;
  background-color: white;
}

.PopoverArrow {
  fill: white;
}
```

### Demo

Here's a complete demo.

## Summary

The steps above outline briefly what's involved in using a Radix Primitive in your application.

These components are low-level enough to give you control over how you want to wrap them. You're free to introduce your own high-level API to better suit the needs of your team and product.

In a few simple steps, we've implemented a fully accessible Popover component, without having to worry about many of its complexities.

- Adheres to [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/dialogmodal) design pattern.
- Can be controlled or uncontrolled.
- Customize side, alignment, offsets, collision handling.
- Optionally render a pointing arrow.
- Focus is fully managed and customizable.
- Dismissing and layering behavior is highly customizable.
