# installation

To get started with Design Blocks, you can install the package using your preferred package manager. Follow these steps:

<Tabs className="mt-2" items={['pnpm','npm', 'yarn', 'bun']} defaultValue="pnpm">
    <Tab value="pnpm">
    ```sh
    pnpm add @design-blocks/native
    ```
    </Tab>

    <Tab value="npm">
    ```sh
    npm add @design-blocks/native
    ```
    </Tab>

    <Tab value="yarn">
    ```sh
    yarn add @design-blocks/native
    ```
    </Tab>

    <Tab value="bun">
    ```sh
    bun add @design-blocks/native
    ```
    </Tab>

</Tabs>

> Keep in mind that Design Blocks is agnostic to whether you are using `Expo` or the `React Native CLI`; the installation steps are the same. Welcome to ease of use!

## Usage

### Config File

To configure Design Blocks, create a blocks.config.ts file (.js works too) and import `createBlocks` and `createTokens` functions from **@design-blocks/native**.

```ts /createTokens/#v /createBlocks/#s
// blocks.config.ts
import { createTokens, createBlocks } from "@design-blocks/native";
```

The `createTokens` function receives a configuration object:

- theme: defines the tokens for your theme, mapping to CSS properties and style props.
- utils: creates custom utilities to enhance your development experience.

And returns an array with the following:

- theme: In position 0 of the array is the theme with generated tokens, and the utilities you defined are already included in the output theme, combined by `createTokens`.

The `createBlocks` function receives a configuration object:

- theme: receives the tokens generated by `createTokens`.
- themes: or it can receive an object with multiple themes generated by `createTokens`. See the [multiple themes](customization/multiple-themes) section for more details.

And returns all the available functions:

- block: Facilitates creating styled React-Native components.
- theme: The `theme` object is passed to the `ThemeProvider`, easing style management and accessibility.
- themes: The `themes` object is passed to the `ThemeProvider`, allowing the use of multiple themes. See the [multiple themes](customization/multiple-themes) section for more details.
- utils: Create custom utils to improve your developer experience.
- css: Facilitates string interpolation for writing CSS in a readable manner.

```ts showLineNumbers
// blocks.config.ts

import { createTokens, createBlocks } from "@design-blocks/native";

const [themeTokens] = createTokens({
  theme: {
    tokens: {
      colors: {
        text: {
          primary: "#000",
          secondary: "#fff",
        },
        red: {
          100: "#FFEEEE",
          200: "#FACDCD",
          ...
        },
      },
    },
    extendTokens: {
      spacings: {
        "7xl": 76,
      },
      radii: {
        "6xl": 32,
      },
      fontSizes: {
        "10xl": 80,
      },
    },
  },
  utils: {
    toPixels: (value: number) => `${value}px`,
    ...
  },
});

export const { block, css, theme } = createBlocks({
  theme: themeTokens,
});
```

### Using Your Configuration File

From this point onwards, you'll be importing block and other functions from blocks.config.

```tsx
import { block, css } from "[path-to]/blocks.config";

const Description = block.Text(({ theme }) => ({
  color: theme.colors.text.primary,
  fontSize: theme.fontSizes.['10xl'],
}));

function Screen() {
  return(
    <Description
      style={css`
        font-Weight: '700';
      `}
    />
  );
}

export default Screen;
```

```tsx
// App.tsx index root application react-native

import React from "react";

import Screen from "./Screen";

import { ThemeProvider } from "@design-blocks/native";

import { theme } from "./blocks.config";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      <Screen />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
};

export default App;
```
