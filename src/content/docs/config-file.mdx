# Config File

We highly recommend using a dedicated `blocks.config.ts` file to configure Design Blocks, in order to get the best experience with IDEs and other integrations. This approach ensures a smoother and more efficient integration, allowing you to fully leverage Design Blocks features and tools in your development environment.

A full featured config file looks like this:

```ts
import { createBlocks, createTokens } from '@design-blocks/native';
import colors from '@design-blocks/colors/tailwind-css';

const lightTheme = {
  tokens: {
    colors: {
      ...
    },
  },
  extendTokens: {
    spacings: {
      ...
    },
    fontSizes: {
      ...
    },
    fontWeights: {
      ...
    },
    radii: {
      ...
    },
  },
} as const;

const utils = {
  ...
}

const [themeTokens] = createTokens({ theme: lightTheme, utils });

export const { block, css, theme } = createBlocks({
  theme: themeTokens,
});
```
