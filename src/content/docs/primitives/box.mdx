## Usage

This example demonstrates how to use Box with the default configuration.

- Create layouts with ease.
- Use it as a container for other components.
- Provide a shorthand way to pass styles via props, example: (bgColor instead of backgroundColor).

```tsx
<Box bgColor="blue" border="xl" p="xs">
  <Text>This is the Box</Text>
</Box>
```

## Import

To use this component in your project, include the following import statement in your file.

```tsx
import { Box } from "@design-blocks/primitives";
```

## Props

Rest assured that Box inherits all the properties of the React Native [View](https://reactnative.dev/docs/view) component.

### styles props

Style props are a way to alter the style of a component by simply passing props to it. It helps to save time by providing helpful shorthand ways to style components.

```tsx
<Box w="lg" h="lg" bgColor="blue" border="xl" m="lg" p="xs" borderRadius="md">
  <Text>This is the Box</Text>
</Box>
```

To find out which properties are theme-aware, see the [Style Props](style-props).

### sx

The system prop that allows defining system overrides as well as additional CSS styles.

```tsx
<Box bgColor="blue" border="xl" p="xs" sx={{ bgColor: "red" }}>
  <Text>This is the Box</Text>
</Box>
```

In this case, `sx` will overwrite the `bgColor` passed as a prop, resulting in a Box with a **red** `backgroundColor`.

See the [`sx`](the-sx-prop) page for more details.

## Unstyled

It's important to note that primitive components come without predefined styles. For more information, please refer to [this link.](../native/configuration)
